# Rust and WebAssembly Documentation

Welcome to an overview of the documentation provided by the [Rust
and WebAssembly Working Group](https://github.com/rustwasm). All of these
projects are managed by the working group; there are other unofficial
documentation resources as well!

Many of these resources take the form of "books"; we collectively call
these "The Rust and WebAssembly Bookshelf." Some are large, some are small.

# Learn about Rust and WebAssembly

If you'd like to learn about Rust and WebAssembly, this is the spot for
you! All of these resources assume that you have programmed a little bit
of Rust and that you have some familiarity with JavaScript. If you want
to learn how to use Rust in your web browser, these resources are a
great place to get started:

## The Rust Wasm Book

[The Rust Wasm Book](docs/book) describes how to use Rust and
WebAssembly together. There's a tutorial to create an end to end project
using Rust and WebAssembly and finally the book concludes with reference
sections full of general, good-to-know information to explore more
with Rust and WebAssembly.

# Dive Into Rust and WebAssembly

If you'd like a deeper dive into Rust and WebAssembly, these resources
are for you. These books are good to look into after you've gone through
the tutorial in [The Rust Wasm Book](docs/book) or you already have some
familiarity with Rust, WebAssembly, and JavaScript. These books go into
more depth about the Rust WebAssesmbly tools and crates.

## The `wasm-bindgen` Guide

[The `wasm-bindgen` Guide](docs/wasm-bindgen) covers the `wasm-bindgen`
tool and crate. `wasm-bindgen` is a Rust library and CLI tool that
facilitate high-level interactions between wasm modules and JavaScript.
This is great to read if you're seeking more information about how
`wasm-bindgen` works, what more you can do with it, and other references
for the `wasm-bindgen` tool and related crates. There's also information
on how you can contribute to the `wasm-bindgen` tool, if you're
curious.

## The `wasm-pack` Book

[The `wasm-pack` Book](docs/wasm-pack) covers the Rust to WebAssembly
workflow tool. This book covers prerequistes, project setup, and
available commands for `wasm-pack`. The `wasm-pack` book has quick start
guides to using generated templates and highlights how the workflow with
those templates works so you can get a working Rust and WebAssembly
project up, running, and deployed fast. If you're interested in
contributing to `wasm-pack`, you will find all that information at the
end of this book too!
